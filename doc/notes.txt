end PARTNAME;

In a string you just conceptually replace \n with & and ignore white space both in and outside the "" marks.
Basically anywhere but in a string you can ignore \n. In a string that would violate the syntax rules.
Any time you see an ; or -- that is effectively the end of the line.
The : is to denote the type of something.
They use strings some times to list values "valuename (number)" or "valuename (number, number, number)"
There is often meta data in how the lines of each string are broken down. 
Sadly they are not trivial to apply.
